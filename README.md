# Microsemi_SmartFusion2_RISCV_ObjectTracker


This RISC-V Demo uses the Future Creative Board (Microsemi SmartFusion 2) with a PIXY camera on a pan/tilt servo mount mounted on a 4 wheel chasis using a dual channel, bidirectional motor driver to follow trained objects from a visual image.  Communication with the PIXY camera is via SPI.


Designed and constructed by Yutian Ren (UCI / Calit2) Microsemi Innovation Laboratory


Project Advisors: Dr. Michael Klopfer and Prof. G.P. Li



(Extended from the Tic-Tac-Toe demo as a project template from Microsemi RISC-V Core Toolkit.  This template project is available here: https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/riscv-junk-drawer)
